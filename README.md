### Frame Accumulation Filter - VirtualDub plugin

Create long exposure images from short exposure videos or photo burst sequences (with a static camera).
Each frame is combined with the previous frame (accumulated) via `max` operation, i.e. brighter pixels in the new frame will replace darker pixels in the previous.
This gives a nice effect e.g. for recordings of fireworks.
